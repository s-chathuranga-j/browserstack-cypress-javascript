# BrowsetStack integration with Cypress on JavaScript

This is a NodeJS project with the dependencies:

- Cypress

To run the code, open the project with IntelliJ (or any other preffered IDE) & locate the test files under the folder "cypress/e2e". Replace the API key value in the code with your own BrowserStack API key first!

To run these tests on BrowserStack you need to execute the command:
- browserstack-cypress run --sync

The test execution can be viewed via your BrowserStack account!
